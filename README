RISE is a prototypal JavaScript object wrapper over WebGL. Adapted from the SOAR toolkit, it implements several important improvements.

* Object model separates constructors and prototypes.
* Buffer/bitmap objects are decoupled from GL wrapper objects.
* Helper functions wrapped in identifying namespaces (math, misc) rather then the main object.
* Optimized for surface and texture generation.
* Non-essential functions from SOAR (heightmaps, noise functions) removed.
* All singletons rewritten as creatable objects.
